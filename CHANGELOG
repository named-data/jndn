  using the deprecated NDNx and binary XML wire format. To enable support while
  you upgrade your code to use NFD, in your main application set
  WireFormat.ENABLE_NDNX = true

  check if the added Data packet satisfies any pending interest. You can use
  getStorePendingInterest() for onDataNotFound in registerPrefix().

  BasicIdentityStorage so that it uses the Android SQLite services.
* examples: In repo_ng added BasicInsertion and WatchedInsertion to show

  registerPrefix, make the onInterest callback optional.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2579 Added callback type OnInterestCallback
  to use in registerPrefix and setInterestFilter instead of OnInterest. The new
  callback is passed the Face so that you can supply the Data with face.putData().
* Face: Changed the OnInterest callback to pass interestFilterId instead of registeredPrefixId.
  (You should use OnInterestCallback instead of the deprecated OnInterest.)
* MemoryContentCache: In registerPrefix, changed the onDataNotFound to OnInterestCallback.
  If your application uses onDataNotFound, you must update your callback function.
* In Interest setter methods, return this so that you can chain calls to update values.
* examples: Changed examples to use OnInterestCallback instead of OnInterest.

Deprecated
* In Face, deprecated registerPrefix where onInterest is type OnInterest. Use the
  registerPrefix where onInterest is OnInterestCallback so you can call face.putData().

  for localhop_security.) Added the optional method Face.isLocal() for the application to check if the
  connection is local. Thanks again to Andrew Brown!
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2531 Handle an incoming NFD LocalControlHeader
  packet and return it in the packet getIncomingFaceId().
